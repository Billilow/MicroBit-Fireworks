## Code
Your light show is engaging and makes use of complex PWM. However, you have hardcoded your entire display though which makes it very difficult to modify, and there is a lot of functions that are very similar. Note the "good memory usage" is a *requirement* to successfully complete the more complex extensions.

## Report
Your report mentions that you use arrays to make your design scalable - you do not however do this in your code, and so your implementation section doesn't accurately describe your implementation. You also mention that your code is modular and scalable, which it isn't. There is no need to mention ARM assembly being difficult in your analysis - that's the aim of the assignment.
